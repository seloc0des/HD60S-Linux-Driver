# Elgato Game Capture HD60 S — USB protocol notes

Living document. Everything here is tagged by how we know it:

- **[OBSERVED]** — measured directly on hardware in this repo, reproducible.
- **[TEARDOWN]** — from published hardware teardown, not verified by us.
- **[UNKNOWN]** — not yet determined. Do not guess these in code.

The device is **not** UVC. `bDeviceClass = 255` (vendor specific) on every
interface, so no in-tree kernel driver will ever bind it.

## 1. Identity

| Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| idVendor | `0x0fd9` (Elgato Systems GmbH) | [OBSERVED] |
| idProduct | `0x005e` | [OBSERVED] |
| Product string | `Game Capture HD60 S` | [OBSERVED] |
| Serial | per-unit, e.g. `0314BC38FC` | [OBSERVED] |
| bcdDevice (fw rev) | `1f.4f` | [OBSERVED] |
| bcdUSB | `2.10` | [OBSERVED, at HS] |

Only the **original HD60 S** is `005e`. The HD60 S+ is different hardware with
a different PID and a hardware H.264 encoder; nothing here applies to it.

### Firmware
No host-side firmware upload is required. The device enumerates with its full
Elgato identity and string descriptors straight from a cold plug, meaning the
CYUSB3014 has already booted its image from onboard SPI flash. [OBSERVED]

This is a meaningful difference from the older Game Capture HD (`0fd9:0044`),
which *did* need a host firmware push. Do not port that logic here.

## 2. Hardware [TEARDOWN]

| Part | Role |
|---|---|
| Cypress/Infineon **CYUSB3014** (ARM926EJ-S) | USB 3.0 device controller, host-facing |
| Nuvoton **M031LD2AE** (Cortex-M0) | housekeeping MCU, peripherals + LED |
| ITE **IT6802E** | HDMI receiver (HDMI → parallel video) |
| ITE **IT66121FN** | HDMI transmitter (passthrough out) |
| Altera **MAX II** CPLD | formats parallel video into the CYUSB3014 GPIF-II bus |
| Winbond **W25Q32JV** 4 MB SPI flash | CYUSB3014 boot image + LED animation data @ `0x300000` |
| ITE **IT1504** | 16-ch LED driver |

The two ARM cores talk over **I2C**; the CYUSB3014 issues commands to the
Nuvoton MCU for peripheral control and status. This matters for us: some
register access from the host is expected to be *tunneled* through to the MCU
rather than serviced directly by the CYUSB3014.

## 3. USB 2.0 fallback personality [OBSERVED]

This is what the device presents when the SuperSpeed link fails to train.
`wTotalLength = 73`, 2 interfaces, 1 configuration, bus powered @ 100 mA.

```
Interface 0  (vendor specific)          — video/stream
  alt 0 : EP 0x83 IN  Isochronous  wMaxPacketSize 0x0000  (0 B — idle/bandwidth-free)
  alt 1 : EP 0x83 IN  Isochronous  wMaxPacketSize 0x0400  (1x1024 =  1024 B/µframe)
  alt 2 : EP 0x83 IN  Isochronous  wMaxPacketSize 0x1400  (3x1024 =  3072 B/µframe)
Interface 1  (vendor specific)          — control/status
  alt 0 : EP 0x81 IN  Interrupt    wMaxPacketSize 0x0040  (64 B, bInterval 1)
```

Note there is **no OUT endpoint at all** in this personality. Every host→device
command must therefore travel over **EP0 control transfers**.

### Bandwidth ceiling — why this mode cannot carry full-rate video

Isochronous HS service is once per microframe (`bInterval 1`), 8000/s:

| Alt | Bytes/µframe | Throughput |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1024 | 8.2 MB/s (66 Mbit/s) |
| 2 | 3072 | **24.6 MB/s (197 Mbit/s)** |

Uncompressed 1080p60 YUY2 is `1920*1080*2*60` = 248 MB/s ≈ **1990 Mbit/s**,
and 1080p60 RGB is worse. Alt 2 is ~10x short. So in USB 2.0 mode the device
can only be doing one of: heavily compressed output, a much lower
resolution/framerate, or refusing to stream video at all. [UNKNOWN] which.

**Consequence for the driver: the USB 2.0 personality is not the target.**

---

## 4. SuperSpeed personality [UNKNOWN]

Not yet captured — the device has so far only linked at 480M on this host,
across two different xHCI controllers (Renesas `0000:04:00.0` and
`0000:08:00.3`).

Expected once a SuperSpeed link trains, based on the CYUSB3014 design:
- a **BOS descriptor** advertising `SUPERSPEED_USB` capability
  (`wSpeedsSupported` bit 3),
- **bulk** IN endpoint(s) with SuperSpeed Endpoint Companion descriptors
  (`bMaxBurst`) replacing the isochronous EP 0x83,
- possibly a bulk **OUT** endpoint for commands, which would change the
  command transport away from EP0-only.

`tools/hd60s-watch.sh` auto-captures this the instant it appears.

Until then the streaming layer must not be finalised.

---

## 5. Control protocol [UNKNOWN]

Nothing about the vendor command set is confirmed. Specifically unknown:

- `bRequest` / `wValue` / `wIndex` values for any operation
- the MCU-presence handshake reportedly required before register access works
- the "tunneled register" form used after that handshake
- register map (input status, EDID, resolution, HDCP state, LED)
- video packet framing, pixel format, resolution negotiation
- audio format and whether audio is muxed into the video endpoint

The interrupt endpoint 0x81 shows activity without any vendor command being
sent, so it is plausibly an unsolicited status/hotplug channel (HDMI signal
present, resolution change). [UNKNOWN] — needs capture to confirm.

### How these get filled in
1. `usbmon` capture of the official driver on Windows/macOS talking to the
   device, then replay/diff. This is the only reliable route — there is no
   public datasheet.
2. Cautious host-side probing of EP0 with benign `GET_` style requests, logging
   which `bRequest` values return data vs stall. Never write blindly: a wrong
   vendor write can brick the SPI flash image.

**Rule for this repo: no invented constants.** If a value is not in a capture,
it does not go in the code.

## 6. HDCP

HDMI sources that assert HDCP will not be capturable, and nothing in this
driver attempts to defeat that. Consoles generally allow disabling HDCP for
game output; that is the supported path.
